## ICD10
A Python library for working with the hierarchy of ICD10 codes. (build top on StefanoTrv/simple_icd_10_CM)

### Overview
ICD10 is a Python library designed to help users explore the structure and details of ICD10 codes. It allows you to retrieve descriptions, hierarchical relationships, and related codes effortlessly.

### Features
- Get detailed information about any ICD10 code, including its description, parent, children, and full parent chain.
- Easy-to-use functions for retrieving and formatting ICD10 data.

### Usage
Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```python
import icd10 as cm

# Format and retrieve detailed data for a specific ICD10 code.
result = cm.get_full_data("S52.112A")
print(result)
```
